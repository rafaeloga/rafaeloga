It is also part of open source [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/).\n\nThe data contains information about US-based flight schedules from 2008. It is made available to us via [Databricks Datasets](https://docs.databricks.com/data/databricks-datasets.html). \n\nFirst, we will create a standard table using Parquet format and then we'll run a query to observe the timing. \n\nThen, we'll run the same query on a Delta table using Delta Engine optimizations and compare the two. \n\n<img alt=\"Side Note\" title=\"Side Note\" style=\"vertical-align: text-bottom; position: relative; height:1.75em; top:0.05em; transform:rotate(15deg)\" src=\"https://files.training.databricks.com/static/images/icon-note.webp\"/> Databricks includes a variety of datasets that you can use to continue learning, or just for practice!

For analysts, a common complaint in querying data lakes is read efficiency; and having a large collection of small files to sift through everytime data is queried can create performance problems. Ideally, a large number of small files should be rewritten into a smaller number of larger files on a regular basis, which will improve the speed of read queries from a table. This is known as compaction. You can compact a table using the `OPTIMIZE` command shown below. \n\nZ-ordering co-locates column information (recall that Delta is columnar storage). Co-locality is used by Delta Lake data-skipping algorithms to dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs to be read. You can specify multiple columns for ZORDER BY as a comma-separated list. However, the effectiveness of the locality drops with each additional column.

Note: The Delta cache is *not* the same as caching in Apache Spark, which we talked about in Module 4. One notable difference is that the Delta cache is stored entirely on the local disk, so that memory is not taken away from other operations within Spark. When enabled, the Delta cache automatically creates a copy of a remote file in local storage so that successive reads are significantly sped up. Unfortunately, to enable it, you must choose a cluster type that is not available in Databricks Community Edition. \n\nTo better understand the differences between Delta caching and Apache Spark caching, please read, [\"Delta and Apache Spark caching.\"](https://docs.databricks.com/delta/optimizations/delta-cache.html#delta-and-apache-spark-caching)","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"42867291-da34-45f7-abdb-ec93b9f98b76"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":3623476344927146,"guid":"c7c610e2-408e-4576-b48e-be13bb82108f","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":15.0,"command":"%run ../Includes/Classroom-Cleanup\n","commandVersion":0,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":0,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"a user","latestUserId":null,"commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"b1fae91d-7148-47f2-98d9-f5fa0cb3649d"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":3623476344927147,"guid":"a92e4bc2-e451-4ff6-bf11-d1a267d1de9c","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":16.0,"command":"%md-sandbox\n&copy; 2020 Databricks, Inc.
