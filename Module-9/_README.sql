These notebooks are meant to help you prepare for the Databricks SQL Analyst accreditation (_coming soon_). The accredidation is meant to assess your understanding of basic Spark Architecture as well as your ability to write SQL queries with Spark SQL. In these notebooks, you will find practical challenges (and their answers) that will help you prepare for the skills-based assessment portion of the accreditation. \n\nYou can learn more about how the accreditation exam will be structured in this [Exam Outline]($./Exam Outline).

You can navigate to them using the links below, or by navigating to the Challenges folder in this file. \n\nEach challenge is designed to work with custom generated data. In each notebook, you **must** run the first cell to generate data for the challenges in that notebook. \n\nEach notebook contains questions related to the notebook topic. Your primary goal is outlined in the `Summary` within the question cell and specifics about how to answer are detailed under `Steps to Complete`. \n\nEach question is followed by a blank `-- TODO` cell.  Write your answer query in that cell. \n\n### Links to practice notebooks\n\n1. [Basic Queries]($./Challenges/01 - Basic Queries)\n1.

For questions where you have created a new temporary view, we have also included a `SELECT *` statement show the resulting view in the Solutions notebook.
